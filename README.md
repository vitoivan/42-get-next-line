<h1 align="center">42_get_next_line</h1>  

> My second project at 42 SÃ£o Paulo, where i need to write a program in C that read a file from a [file descriptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor) and return the fist line of this file.
> Here the idea was learn about [staic variables](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-variables-in-c/) and file descriptors  

- This project was made according to [Norm](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/960/norme.en.pdf)

- This project in general was easy, but the major struggling here was avoid memory leaks (all funcions are tested with valgrind)
  
> In the bonus part i need to read from different file descriptors and also maintain the tracking of the content of these files using just one static variable
